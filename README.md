*Classification of  disaster news into fake and real*
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.The ubiquitousness of smartphones
enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested
in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).But, it’s not always clear
whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster
**In this project I’ve approached the problem with different techniques ranging from LSTMs to BERT Transformer**
